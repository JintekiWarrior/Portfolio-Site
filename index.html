              It all started when my father wanted a website for his business. He couldn't afford to pay for one but he knew it would greatly help. 
              I told him that I would look into it. I have always been good with computers so how hard could it be? Well after some research I realized how much 
              actually had to go into designing such a thing. I also realized that learning how to do this could be quite beneficial. So I studied and practiced,
              but soon ran into trouble and knew I needed a more structured way of learning then what I was doing. I found a school, General Assembly, that 
              claimed to be able to teach me the skills I required. The rest is history, now I am working every day to become the best web developer I can be.
